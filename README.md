  Creator package of <code>istanbul</code> framework. 
</p>

### Usage

Run this code in the directory where you want to create an `istanbul` project:

```bash
npm init istanbul
```

and answer the questions asked of you. That's it.

### Thanks

This package is clearly inspired by [`create-vue`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-vue). So we owe a debt of gratitude to `create-vue` developer [`Haogun Jiang`](https://github.com/sodatea).
